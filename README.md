## **About this app**

_- AmazingSynthProducts.NET is a simple mock web store with account registration/login/overview, product pages and a customer contact form_

The database schema is set up with Entity Framework using a code-first approach and the data is stored in a local SQLite file: `webapp.db`. Accounts are created using the [ASP.NET Core Identity API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/identity). The first user to register an account is automatically assigned the role of **Admin**. This site was mainly created to get familiar with and practice ASP.NET Core and the Controller workflow.
